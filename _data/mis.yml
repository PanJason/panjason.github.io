  Besides research, I enjoy doing all kinds of sports. I played soccer for
  several years and have supported Man. Utd for over a decade. I once got
  injured in this super intensive sport and took 2 arthroscopy operations for
  FAI (Femoroacetabular Impingement) in the year 2022 Feel free to drop me email
  if you want to consult any FAI related questions. I also participate in
  running, swimming, cycling and other ball games (tennis, table tennis).
  I also like music and tried to practice singing every week. I am currently 
  learning french.
