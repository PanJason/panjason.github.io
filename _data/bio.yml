  I am a Ph.D. candidate in [EDIC Computer and Communication
  Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/)
  at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), advised by [Prof. Sanidhya
  Kashyap](https://sanidhya.github.io/). I received my B.S in Computer Science
  with Summa cum laude from [Turing
  Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm)
  at Peking University. I also minored in Finance.


  My research focuses on making existing data-intensive system software more
  efficient in managing heterogeneous hardware resources (e.g. GPU, DPU, CXL,
  RDMA) and diverse workloads. Specifically, I focus on two main themes. 
  * **Scalability**: ensuring that system software can scale with growing thread
  parallelism and resource capacity without introducing bottlenecks,
  particularly in the memory subsystem. 
  * **Flexibility**: enabling adaptive resource management strategies tailored to
  varying hardware and workload, especially heterogeneous memory and storage
  devices.

  Beyond research, I also contribute frequently to open-source projects, such as
  SGLang and Linux. Both of them are "kernel" related, in some sense.
